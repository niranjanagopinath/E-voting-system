# E-Voting System

A privacy-preserving electronic voting platform that uses homomorphic encryption to tally votes without decrypting individual ballots, threshold cryptography so no single party can access results alone, and an immutable hash-chained ledger for auditability

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (running)
- Minimum 8 GB RAM
- The following ports must be free: 3000, 8000, 5432, 8545

---

## Installation and Setup

```bash
cd E-voting-system
docker-compose up -d
```

Give it about 30 seconds for the database to initialize, then verify:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend (Swagger) | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Health check | http://localhost:8000/health |

To tear everything down (including the database volume):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## System Architecture

The project is a four-service stack orchestrated by Docker Compose:

```
React 18 (:3000)  --->  FastAPI (:8000)  --->  PostgreSQL 15 (:5432)
                                          --->  Ganache (:8545)
```

- **Frontend** serves the voter, admin, trustee, auditor, and security-engineer interfaces. Role-based tab visibility is enforced at login.
- **Backend** exposes REST endpoints for authentication, vote encryption, tallying, ledger management, verification, and operational audit. JWT-based auth with optional TOTP MFA.
- **PostgreSQL** stores users, elections, encrypted votes, trustee shares, tallying sessions, partial decryptions, results, audit logs, incidents, and disputes.
- **Ganache** acts as a local Ethereum node for publishing finalized election results on-chain.

---

## Running a Demo Election

The system ships with a built-in testing workflow. Open the frontend at http://localhost:3000 and log in as `admin`.

### Phase 1 — Setup (Testing tab)
1. **Setup Trustees** — generates 5 trustees and splits the election private key into 5 shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing.
2. **Generate 100 Mock Votes** — creates 100 Paillier-encrypted ballots. Takes roughly 20 seconds due to 2048-bit encryption.
3. **Generate 100 Mock Ballots** — registers the ballots in the database.
4. **Tally Ballots** — aggregates all ciphertexts homomorphically (multiplies encrypted values to get encrypted sums).
5. **Start Tallying Process** — marks the election as ready for trustee decryption.

### Phase 2 — Decryption (Trustees tab)
6. Click **Decrypt** on any 3 of the 5 trustees. Each one contributes a partial decryption using their key share. The UI shows progress (1/3, 2/3, 3/3).

### Phase 3 — Finalization (Testing tab)
7. **Finalize Tally on Blockchain** — reconstructs the plaintext result from the 3 partial decryptions and publishes it to Ganache.

### Phase 4 — Results (Results tab)
8. View the vote distribution per candidate, the declared winner, and the blockchain transaction hash.

## User Roles

| Role | Credential | What they can access |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Voter | voter1 through voter5 | Voter Access, Results, Ledger, Verification |
| Admin | admin | All tabs |
| Trustee | trustee | Trustees, Results, Ledger, Verification |
| Auditor | auditor | Results, Ledger, Ops & Audit, Verification |
| Security Engineer | security_engineer | Security Lab, Ops & Audit, Ledger, Verification |

MFA (TOTP) can be enabled per voter from the Voter Access dashboard. See [docs/MFA_CODE_GUIDE.md](MFA_CODE_GUIDE.md) for details on generating codes.

---

## Cryptographic Design

### Homomorphic encryption
Votes are encrypted using the Paillier cryptosystem with 2048-bit keys. The additive homomorphic property allows the backend to compute E(v1 + v2 + ... + vn) = E(v1) * E(v2) * ... * E(vn) without decrypting any individual ballot. The frontend additionally performs client-side encryption with RSA-OAEP via the Web Crypto API before submitting to the backend.

### Threshold decryption
The election private key is split into 5 shares (Shamir's Secret Sharing, threshold 3). No single trustee holds the full key. Decryption requires at least 3 trustees to contribute partial results, which are combined server-side to reconstruct the plaintext tally.

### Blind signatures
Voter credential issuance uses an RSA blind-signature protocol. The authentication zone (Zone 1) knows who the voter is; the vote-casting zone (Zone 3) only sees an anonymous signed token. The issuer signs a blinded token it cannot read, and the voter unblinds it. This breaks the link between identity and ballot.

### Immutable ledger
Encrypted votes are appended to a hash-chained, Merkle-tree-backed ledger. Blocks go through a BFT consensus simulation (propose, approve x3, finalize) before they are committed. Merkle proofs let voters verify inclusion without revealing vote content.

### Audit chain
All system operations (credential issuance, vote submission, tally actions, incident reports) are logged in a tamper-evident hash chain where each entry contains the hash of the previous entry.

## Local Development

### Start everything (Docker)
```bash
cd E-voting-system
docker-compose up -d              # Start all services
docker-compose ps                  # Verify running
```
| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Health check | http://localhost:8000/health |

### Frontend (without Docker)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start                          # Opens http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend (without Docker)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
The backend expects a running PostgreSQL instance. Set `DATABASE_URL` in your environment.

### Run tests
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v                    # All 119 tests
python -m pytest tests/test_epic4.py -v       # Specific file
```

### Reset database
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/mock/reset-database?confirm=true"
```
Or click **Reset Database** in the Testing tab of the frontend.

### Common Docker commands
```bash
docker-compose up -d              # Start all services
docker-compose down                # Stop all services
docker-compose down -v             # Stop + wipe database
docker-compose logs -f             # Stream logs
docker-compose restart backend     # Restart one service
docker-compose up -d --build       # Rebuild images
```

### Git workflow
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main               # Triggers CI + Vercel deploy
```

---

## Deployment (Vercel)

The React frontend is configured for deployment on **Vercel**.

### Quick deploy
```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd E-voting-system
vercel link
vercel --prod
```

Or connect the GitHub repository directly in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/new) — it auto-detects `vercel.json` and deploys on every push.

### Configuration
- `vercel.json` at project root defines build command, output directory, SPA rewrites, and security headers
- Build: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
- Output: `frontend/build`

> **Note:** Vercel hosts the frontend SPA only. The backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Ganache) must be deployed separately (Docker Compose, cloud VM, or container service).

---

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Two workflows run automatically on push/PR to `main`:

### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
| Job | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **backend-tests** | Runs 103 Python tests against PostgreSQL 15 + Redis 7 service containers |
| **frontend-build** | Builds the React production bundle with Node 18 |
| **integration** | Docker Compose smoke test — builds images, checks `/health`, verifies frontend |

### CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
Deploys the frontend to Vercel on every push to `main`.

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
| Secret | How to get it |
|--------|--------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | [Vercel → Settings → Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | From `.vercel/project.json` after `vercel link` |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | From `.vercel/project.json` after `vercel link` |

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) and [CI_CD_PIPELINE.md](CI_CD_PIPELINE.md) for full details.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "Action Failed" on vote generation | Encryption takes ~20s for 100 ballots | Wait for it to finish; do not click again |
| Key mismatch on finalize | Steps were run out of order or repeated | Reset the database and redo steps 1-7 in order |
| Decrypt button greyed out | Tallying process not started | Complete all 5 setup steps first |
| No results after finalize | Fewer than 3 trustees decrypted | Decrypt with at least 3 trustees, then finalize |
| Containers fail to start | Port conflict or stale volumes | `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d --build` |
| "mfa_pending" shown as role | Stale browser localStorage | Clear localStorage for localhost:3000 and refresh |

This is a demonstration system built for academic evaluation. It is not intended for production use without significant hardening (HSM key management, physical trustee separation, network-layer encryption, voter identity verification, external audit infrastructure).
